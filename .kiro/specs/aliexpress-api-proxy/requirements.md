# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for an AliExpress Affiliate API Proxy Server that enables a custom GPT to securely access the AliExpress Affiliate API through a server-side proxy. The proxy handles the complex SHA256 signature generation required by AliExpress while providing a simple REST API interface for the GPT to consume.

## Glossary

- **Proxy_Server**: The backend service that forwards requests to the AliExpress API with proper authentication
- **Custom_GPT**: The OpenAI GPT instance that will consume the proxy API
- **AliExpress_API**: The official AliExpress Affiliate API at api-sg.aliexpress.com
- **SHA256_Signature**: The cryptographic signature required by AliExpress for API authentication
- **App_Secret**: The private key used to generate the SHA256 signature
- **API_Parameters**: The query parameters and data sent to AliExpress endpoints
- **JSON_Response**: The structured data returned from AliExpress API calls

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a custom GPT, I want to search for products on AliExpress, so that I can provide users with affiliate product recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Custom_GPT sends a search request with search terms, THE Proxy_Server SHALL forward the request to the AliExpress_API with proper authentication
2. THE Proxy_Server SHALL append all necessary AliExpress_API parameters to the request
3. THE Proxy_Server SHALL compute the SHA256_Signature using the App_Secret and request parameters
4. THE Proxy_Server SHALL return the JSON_Response from AliExpress_API to the Custom_GPT
5. IF the AliExpress_API returns an error, THEN THE Proxy_Server SHALL forward the error response to the Custom_GPT

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the proxy to handle AliExpress API authentication automatically, so that I don't need to implement complex signature generation in the GPT.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Proxy_Server SHALL store the App_Secret securely as an environment variable
2. THE Proxy_Server SHALL generate the SHA256_Signature for each request using the App_Secret and API_Parameters
3. THE Proxy_Server SHALL include the computed signature in the sign parameter when calling AliExpress_API
4. THE Proxy_Server SHALL handle all required AliExpress authentication parameters automatically
5. THE Proxy_Server SHALL validate that all required parameters are present before making requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a custom GPT, I want to access different AliExpress API endpoints, so that I can retrieve various types of product and affiliate data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Proxy_Server SHALL support multiple AliExpress_API endpoints through a single proxy interface
2. WHEN the Custom_GPT specifies an endpoint and parameters, THE Proxy_Server SHALL route the request to the correct AliExpress_API endpoint
3. THE Proxy_Server SHALL preserve all input parameters from the Custom_GPT in the forwarded request
4. THE Proxy_Server SHALL support category-based searches with language parameters
5. THE Proxy_Server SHALL return responses in the same JSON format as the original AliExpress_API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the proxy deployed to a reliable hosting service, so that the custom GPT can access it consistently without downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Proxy_Server SHALL be deployed to a free hosting service with high availability
2. THE Proxy_Server SHALL respond to requests within 10 seconds under normal conditions
3. THE Proxy_Server SHALL handle concurrent requests from multiple GPT instances
4. THE Proxy_Server SHALL provide HTTPS endpoints for secure communication
5. THE Proxy_Server SHALL include proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can easily integrate the proxy with my custom GPT.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Proxy_Server SHALL provide an OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification document
2. THE documentation SHALL include all available endpoints with request/response examples
3. THE documentation SHALL specify required parameters and their formats
4. THE documentation SHALL include authentication requirements if implemented
5. THE documentation SHALL provide clear usage instructions and limitations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic security measures, so that unauthorized users cannot abuse the proxy service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE security is implemented, THE Proxy_Server SHALL validate API tokens before processing requests
2. THE Proxy_Server SHALL rate limit requests to prevent abuse
3. THE Proxy_Server SHALL log requests for monitoring and debugging purposes
4. THE Proxy_Server SHALL sanitize input parameters to prevent injection attacks
5. THE Proxy_Server SHALL never expose the App_Secret in responses or logs
